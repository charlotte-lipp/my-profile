	     <h3>🏐 Volley-ball</h3>

	     <h2>PASSIONS</h2>
	     <h3>✍🏼 Drawing</h3>
	       <p>I love drawing. Although I used to draw as a child, I initially took up drawing again to work on my concentration. What's more, it allows me to do something creative and to relax. </p>
          <h3>🤸‍♀️ Gymnastics</h3>
	       <p>Although I don't do it anymore, it's a sport I did for 4 years and that I love. I had the opportunity to compete and was academic champion in 2019</p>
